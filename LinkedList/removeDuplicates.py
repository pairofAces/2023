# Remove Duplicates From Linked List

# You're given the head of singly linked list, where the nodes are in sorted order.
# Create a function that returns a modified version of the Linked List that doesn't
# contain any nodes with duplicate values. 

# The Linked List should be modified in place, meaning there shouldn't be a new
# list being produced. 
    # the modified list should still be in sorted order.

# Each LinkedList node has an integer (value) and a (next) node pointing to
# the next node in the list or to None/null, if it's the tail of the list. 

class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.next = None
